# 🌟 Mojitown

**Mojitown** is an emotionally interactive AI village where users create customizable characters ("Mojis") who live, grow, and interact within a cozy virtual world. Each Moji has a distinct personality and can support users emotionally through playful, therapeutic interactions and rich social simulation.


## 📌 Project Scope

This project explores how emotionally aware AI companions can support wellness and everyday reflection in a calming, character-driven environment. In Stage 1 (April–June), Mojitown will focus on:
- Creating custom characters with distinct personalities and roles
- Building a visual simulation where Mojis interact with one another
- Allowing users to engage in AI conversations with Mojis based on their traits


## 🎯 Target Users

- Young adults (18–35) looking for emotional support in a low-pressure environment
- Neurodiverse individuals who benefit from consistent and calming digital routines
- Cozy game lovers and creatives who enjoy customizable character-based experiences
- Users interested in light, emotionally intelligent AI companions
